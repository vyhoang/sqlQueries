1. Use the Tennis database.

SQL Command:
USE	TENNIS;

2. Execute the following queries and save the results. Also save the command you created to answer the query.
A. Get the numbers of the teams of which the player with the name Parmenter and initial R is a member; in this example, we assume that no two players have the same name and initials.

SQL Command:
SELECT 		TEAMNO
FROM 		TEAMS
WHERE 		PLAYERNO =
			(SELECT		PLAYERNO
			 FROM 		PLAYERS
			 WHERE		NAME = 'Parmenter'
			 AND		INITIALS = 'R')
;

Result:
TEAMNO
1


B. For each penalty, find the payment number, the amount, and the number and name of the player who incurred it.

SQL Command:
SELECT		PAYMENTNO, PENALTIES.PLAYERNO, AMOUNT, NAME
FROM		PENALTIES, PLAYERS
WHERE		PENALTIES.PLAYERNO = PLAYERS.PLAYERNO
;

Result:
PAYMENTNO,PLAYERNO,AMOUNT,NAME
1,6,100.00,Parmenter
2,44,75.00,Baker
3,27,100.00,Collins
4,104,50.00,Moorman
5,44,25.00,Baker
6,8,25.00,Newcastle
7,44,30.00,Baker
8,27,75.00,Collins



C. For ALL players, get the player number and a list of the numbers of teams for which they have ever played. Some players may not have played for teams in the database. Hint a JOIN of some kind is needed.

SQL Command:
SELECT		P.PLAYERNO, M.TEAMNO
FROM		PLAYERS	AS P LEFT JOIN MATCHES AS M
		ON P.PLAYERNO = M.PLAYERNO
;

Result:
PLAYERNO,TEAMNO
2,1
6,1
6,1
6,1
7,NULL
8,1
8,2
27,2
28,NULL
39,NULL

83,1
95,NULL
100,NULL
104,2
112,2
112,2

D. Get the number of each player who won at least one match. A win from matches is more wins than losses.

SELECT		DISTINCT PLAYERNO
FROM		MATCHES
WHERE		WON > LOST
